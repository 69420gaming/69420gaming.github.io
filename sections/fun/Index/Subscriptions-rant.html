        <p>Subscriptions are literally the worst cancer to the mobile app industry!</p>

        <p>
           Like seriously! they restrict users from using certain features until they pay a monthly/yearly subscription! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's take the kids game <b>Bluey: Let's Play!</b> by a company called <b>Budge Studios</b> for example. They limit Kids into one Area until they pay a monthly subscription, which is about <strong>$6.99</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            if you want your kid to play the game for a year, you will pay about <strong>$83.88</strong>. which is expensive!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Another Example is <b>Adobe Inc.</b>. Which is the company behind the popular photo editor known as <b>Photoshop</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          They had a One-Time Subscription called <b>Adobe Creative Suite</b> with its final release being <b>CS6</b> in 2012, which is a year before they moved to a monthly subscription called <b>Adobe Creative Cloud</b>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Creative cloud Costs <strong>$59.99 per month</strong> for all apps. but if you want to use their apps for a year, then you will pay about <strong>$719.88</strong>, which is damn expensive!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          but if you used Creative Cloud from the beginning non-stop, then you have paid about <strong>$7,918.68</strong>. which is too much expensive!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Subscriptons are only getting worse & it absolutely makes me infuriated!
        </p>

        <p>
            why not just do other good practices instead of such rampant restrictions? it's much better!
