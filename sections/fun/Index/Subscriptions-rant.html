        <h1>A Rant about Subscriptions</h1>
        <h4>Created: February 20, 2025</h4>

        <p>Subscriptions are literally the worst cancer to the mobile app industry!</p>

        <p>
           Like seriously! they restrict users from using certain features until they pay a monthly/yearly subscription! 
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's take the kids game <b>Bluey: Let's Play!</b> by a company called <b>Budge Studios</b> for example. They limit Kids into one Area until they pay a monthly subscription, which is about <strong>$6.99</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            if you want your kid to play the game for a year, you will pay about <strong>$83.88</strong>. which is expensive!
        </p>

        <p>
            Subscriptons are only getting worse & it absolutely makes me infuriated!
        </p>

        <p>
            why not just do other good practices instead of such rampant restrictions? it's much better!
