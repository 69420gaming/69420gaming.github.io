      So i've heard of something called <strong>Constructed Languages</strong> (<em>conlang</em> for short).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      a <em>Conlang</em> is a type of language made for a specific purpose, especially fiction.
    </p>

      the best example of a Conlang is <strong>Toki Pona</strong>, a Conlang created by a Canadian linguist named <em>Sonja Lang</em> that has only around 120 words.
