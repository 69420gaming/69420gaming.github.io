    <h2><b>December 29, 2024</b> <i>A Statement about the fall of the Assad Regime.</i></h2>
    
    <p>
      It's a great thing to see people finally freeing Syria from such a Tyrant Leader (aka Bashar al-Assad), he literally detained his own people who are against him & horribly tortured them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hopefully everything will be okay in syria after 53 years of Tyranny of the Assad Regime!
